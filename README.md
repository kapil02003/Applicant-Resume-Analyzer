# Applicant Resume Analyzer (ARA)

**Applicant Resume Analyzer (ARA)** is an intelligent web-based application designed to automate and streamline the resume screening and candidate evaluation process. It helps organizations efficiently analyze large volumes of resumes and make data-driven hiring decisions.

ARA uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to extract meaningful information from resumes, including skills, education, experience, and contact details. Based on this analysis, the system identifies the most suitable job role or professional domain for each applicant.

Once categorized, candidates are ranked within their respective job roles using relevance scoring and profile similarity. This enables recruiters to quickly shortlist the most relevant profiles without manually reviewing every resume.

By converting unstructured resume data into structured insights, ARA improves hiring efficiency, reduces screening time, and ensures consistency and fairness throughout the recruitment process.
